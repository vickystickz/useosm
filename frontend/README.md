# UseOSM Frontend

This is the frontend for the **UseOSM** project, built using [Astro](https://astro.build/), a modern web framework. The frontend serves as the user-facing interface for showcasing the UseOSM initiative and its resources.

## Project Overview

The UseOSM frontend is designed to:

- Highlight organizations and platforms that use OpenStreetMap (OSM).
- Provide an engaging and user-friendly interface for exploring OSM-related resources.
- Support community engagement through events, webinars, and contributions.

## Project Structure

The frontend follows a modular structure:

- **`src/`**: Contains all source code, including:
  - **`components/`**: Reusable UI components organized by feature (e.g., `footer`, `header`, `ui`).
  - **`layouts/`**: Layout templates for pages.
  - **`pages/`**: Individual pages for the website.
  - **`styles/`**: Global and component-specific styles.
  - **`utils/`**: Utility functions for common tasks.
- **`public/`**: Static assets such as images and `robots.txt`.
  - Includes theme-specific logos: `logo_green.svg` (light theme) and `logo_white.svg` (dark theme).
- **`docs/`**: Documentation for the frontend architecture.
  - **`architecture/`**: Contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document key technical decisions.
- **`astro.config.mjs`**: Configuration file for the Astro framework.
- **`package.json`**: Lists project dependencies and scripts.

## Development Workflow

This project uses Husky and lint-staged to enforce code quality and formatting standards. These tools ensure that all code committed to the repository meets the project's guidelines.

- Husky: Manages Git hooks to run checks before commits.
- Lint-Staged: Runs linters and formatters on staged files.

To manually trigger these checks, you can run:

```
pnpm lint
pnpm format:check
```
