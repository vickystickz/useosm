descriptionSectionSubHeader: What This Means
descriptionSectionContent: As urban populations surge and cities struggle to keep pace—managing housing, infrastructure, and public services under mounting pressure—planners and policymakers need accurate, ground-level geographic data to make decisions that shape lives for generations. OpenStreetMap, with its open data and global community, fills critical urban mapping gaps in fast-growing and underrepresented cities across the world. Powered by volunteers and supported by civic organizations, OSM enables urban planners, local governments, and communities to design, develop, and advocate for cities that work for everyone.
